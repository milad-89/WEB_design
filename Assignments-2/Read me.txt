In this assignment I used an externall CSS file to create different classes of styles to be able to modify the different part of the web page.
I created a personnal page for myself in order to be able to have it in the future as a real personnal page.

For each segment like table or header or menu, first I set the font properties, then set them all to be center of the page and other properties like having a border around them or not.
There are the list of tags that are used in my code:

Favicon: I used an icon I created for one of my research in the past.

Table: I brought my education info in the table with solid border.

Form: I created a form for the user to add their info, with input and label
